# Generative-models
Solution of two problems: anomaly detection in the domain of finance and anomaly detection in the domain of cyber security. Solve problems using Generative models.

## Anomaly detection in the domain of finance

Fraud prevention system is actually saving consumers millions of dollars per year.

 Goals of the work are:
1. Fill missing values using generative model (Autoencoder)
2. Measure the perfomence of autoencoder approach perfomence and compare with statistical approaches (i.e From here)
3. Reduce the dimenssion of the data using Principal component analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis and compare the impact on selected machine learning model
